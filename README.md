# bert-loves-chemistry
bert-loves-chemistry: a repository of HuggingFace models applied on chemical SMILES data for drug design, chemical modelling, etc.

Right now the notebooks are all for the RoBERTa model (a variant of BERT) trained on the task of masked-language modelling (MLM).

Todo:
- [x]  Finish writing notebook to train model
- [x]  Finish notebook to preload and run predictions on a single molecule â€”> test if HuggingFace works
- [ ]  Train RoBERTa model for 10 epochs
- [ ]  Combine train + test notebooks
- [ ]  Create documentation + writing, visualizations for notebook.
- [ ]  Setup PR into DeepChem
